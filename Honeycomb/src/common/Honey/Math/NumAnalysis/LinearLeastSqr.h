      * Get a best-fit solution to the system: \f$ X \vec{b} = \vec{y} \f$
      * where the rows of (m x n) _X_ and m-dim \f$\vec{y}\f$ form a system of _m_ linear equations,
      * and n-dim \f$\vec{b}\f$ contains unknowns assumed to be linearly related.
      *
      * Given the residual (error) as \f$ \vec{r} = X \vec{b} - \vec{y} \f$, the least squares approach is to minimize
      * the residual's Euclidean \f$\ell^2\f$-norm (aka. magnitude) \f$ \| \vec{r} \| \f$. \n
      * Thus, the least squared problem becomes: \f$\displaystyle \min_{\vec{b}} \left\| X \vec{b} - \vec{y} \right\|_2 \f$ \n
      * It can be shown that this minimization problem can be uniquely solved using the SVD and the pseudo-inverse.
      *
      * ### Example: Curve Fitting
      * ______________________________
      * Consider a quadratic curve: \f$ 1 + x + x^2 = y \f$ \n
      * Let's say we have a series of \f$(x,y)\f$ samples on a graph that we want to fit to our curve.
      * If we plug in our samples directly we will find the left/right-hand sides don't agree,
      * there are errors and the best we can do is minimize them.
      *
      * Let's introduce the linearly related unknowns into the curve equation: \n
      * \f$ b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 = y \f$ \n
      * We want to find the coefficients of \f$\vec{b}\f$ which minimize the errors across all samples (a best-fit curve).
      *
      * With the model formulated we must now work it into a linear system for the solver.
      * For each \f$(x,y)\f$ sample we append a row \f$(1,x,x^2)\f$ to _X_, and a row (_y_) to \f$\vec{y}\f$.
      * We now have all the parameters needed to solve for \f$\vec{b}\f$.
      *
      * \param x    A (m x n) matrix of function coefficients. In the usual case m > n, ie. there are more samples than unknowns.
      * \param y    A m-dim vector of function results
      * \param b    Result: a n-dim vector of coefficients that best approximates the solution
