/// A thread lock for shared data where there may be many readers and one writer.
/**
  * A thread acquiring a writer lock will suspend execution while there are readers. \n
  * The lock is recursive: one thread can acquire the lock multiple times, which must be followed by the same number of unlocks. \n
  * This class uses atomics, so locking without contention is faster than a platform Mutex.
