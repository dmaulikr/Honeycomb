  * Ownership is transferred to `ToLock` on construction, and then returned to `FromLock` on destruction.
  *
  * This class can be used to atomically acquire a unique writer lock from a shared reader lock:
  *
  *     SharedMutex mutex;
  *     SharedMutex::SharedScoped readLock(mutex);
  *     //Read ownership acquired, read data...
  *     {
  *         TransferLock<decltype(readLock), SharedMutex::Scoped> writeLock(readLock);
  *         //Write ownership acquired in this scope, write data...
  *     }
  *     //Read ownership re-acquired
